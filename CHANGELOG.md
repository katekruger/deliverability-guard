## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project scaffolding: `src/` layout, package skeleton, CI, and repo hygiene
  files, per `BUILD-PLAN.md`.
- `engine/posterior.py`: beta-binomial posterior on complaint/bounce rates,
  trip decisions on the lower credible bound (never the point estimate), and
  hierarchical partial pooling across mailboxes within a domain.
- `engine/state.py`: `OK` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `STALE` data-availability
  state machine, with the present-to-absent transition modeled as its own
  alert.
- `engine/changepoint.py`: one-sided CUSUM sequential change detection on
  the bounce/complaint stream.
- `docs/statistics.md`: why fixed-window complaint-rate breakers are
  structurally wrong at cold-outbound volume, with the worked 0.15-message
  example.
- ADR 0002: beta-binomial posterior with hierarchical pooling.
